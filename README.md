# SLA-3D-printing
CAD file created in Autodesk Fusion 360 for use in Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing.

It has been printed on Formlabs SuccincRuff Form 2 SLA 3D printer using Grey Pro resin with a layer thickness on the Z-axis equal to 0.050 mm. The final piece has been washed (using Form Wash) in isopropyl alcohol for 20 min and post-cured (Form Cure) for 60 min at 60 degrees Celsius.
 
The 3D piece can be used, for example, as a master mould for soft-lithography replication methods using soft elastomeric materials to fabricate a microfluidic chip.
