# SLA-3D-printing
CAD file created in Autodesk Fusion 360 for use in Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing.

It has been printed on Formlabs SuccincRuff Form 2 SLA 3D printer using Grey Pro resin with a layer thickness on the Z-axis equal to 0.050 mm. The final piece has been washed (using Form Wash) in isopropyl alcohol for 20 min and post-cured (Form Cure) for 60 min at 60 degrees Celsius.
 
The 3D piece can be used, for example, as a master mould for soft-lithography replication methods using soft elastomeric materials to fabricate a microfluidic chip.

Each of the designs contains 3 independent channels with the same height (100 microns) and different widths (from 2 mm to 4 mm to 8 mm). The length of the channels is 10 mm. This configurations allows to tailor the wall shear stress inside the microchannels allowing:
- running the channels simultaneously using for the same flow rate defined (3 independent channels connected to the same source pump (peristaltic, pressure-drive, syringe-based))
- possibility to connect the outlet of one channel to the inlet of the second chanel... (Be aware of the distinct hydrostatic pressures inside each of the channels) 
- running 3 channels with the same geometry in series using the same source pump with the different positions for tubing
