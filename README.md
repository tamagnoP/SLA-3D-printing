# SLA-3D-printing
Desing created in Autodesk Fusion 360 to be used for SLA 3D printing.

3D printing tested on Formlabs SuccincRuff model Form 2 using the Grey Pro resin with a layer thickness on Z-axis equal to 0.050 mm. 
Following the printing step, the printring holders was inserted in the Form Wash to remove the uncured resin using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 20 min, and cured for 60 min at 60 degress Celsius in the Form cure. 

The resulting 3D printed piece can be used as a master mould for soft-lithography to replicate the strctures using soft elastometic materials to construct a simple microfluidic chip.
